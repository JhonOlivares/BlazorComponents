# Blazor Components
Please check out the videos on my youtube channel to understand how to create and how to use these components.

I wanted to created some UI components with Blazor that are similar to the ones from DevExpress / DevExtreme. 

## DataGrid
I am starting with the DataGrid. So far I have implemented Column configurations, Formatting, Alignment, Sorting and Paging.

- This video covers the Column Configurations, Formatting and Alignment.
